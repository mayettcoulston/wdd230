                <h3>Demography</h3>
                <p >Nairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since 
                    its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the 
                    African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth 
                    rate of Nairobi was estimated in 2023 to be 2.09% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi's 
                    population will reach 5 million people in 2025.
                    Given this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth 
                    rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 5.5% within the city, 
                    mainly in the high-density, low-income areas of the city which can make them seem even 
                    denser than the higher-income neighbourhoods</p>

                <p>Nairobi has numerous recreational green areas. The largest is the Nairobi National Park, 
                    located in the Southern side of the city. Other recreational areas and protected forests 
                    include Uhuru Park, Central Park, John Michuki Park, Nairobi Arboretum, City Park, 
                    Uhuru Gardens, Jeevanjee Gardens, Karura Forest, Ngong forest, and Ololua forest.
